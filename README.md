## AJAX Autocomplete
This is part of AJAX sample project while I was learning full-stack course at Le Wagon.
The web is mainly send GET request to the Le Wagon auto-complete API to get the suggest words (auto-complete).
When you click on the result, it just open the new webpage to show the recipe from target cookbook website.

Click here for the webpage.
